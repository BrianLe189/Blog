This is to track my progress over time
for different areas I want to learn about.


Professional:
1.SQL (in progress)
 - for a job interview
 - Always a useful skill
 - FCC, Odin, and one other youtube video

2. Network + (in progress)
 - Almost done with professor messer's video playlist 85/93
 - Then onto practice exams and PBQs 

3. Odin project (on pause)
 - Just general learning
4. Maybe one other app or idea so I can deploy (not yet started)
   something that is personally useful or can be used
   by others
 - Real world impact + passion
5. Vim/Neo Vim (on pause)
 - https://vim-adventures.com/
 - Easier searching?
 - Writing this documentation down in markdown?


Personal:
1. Automatic Fedora Updates
2. Backup data to cloud storage
 - Automate it
3. Git hub pages or figure out how to write stuff in markdown
