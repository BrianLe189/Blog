Decided to start blogging just to keep track of things. Github seemed like an okay place to blog. 

What I did so far today:
Moved a couple of directories that are linked to my git repository within a newly create directory using mkdir and mv.

Figure out what kind of formatting I should put my dates and times in and I stumbled upon ISO 8601, I just kind of skimmed it over and now my blog posts will be formatted like that. Ex: December 15th, 1998 in ISO 8601 standard would be 1998-12-15. It is sorted from left to right by largest unit of time to smallest unit of time. I misnamed this file by using "vi 22-06-04", I'll have to go back and change it to 2022-06-04 by using the mv command.

I have to link this local folder to my github repo after I finish this.

Things currently on my plate:
Studying for Net+ through professor messer youtube videos

Things I want to put on my plate next:
1. Automatic updates on my fedora system
   -Maybe this will help me better understand services and automate things
   -Since I'll only be doing this on my pc, I'll be able to rollback the changes,   I can boot into previous fedora versions, and I am physically next to my pc to troubleshoot.
   -https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AutoUpdates
2. Find a better way to blog that through vi? or maybe I can use vim, or some other text editor that is better suited
   -Vi or Vim could be a great way for me to learn
   -Can make editing a pain
3. Learn how to backup my data to cloud storage and then automate it on a weekly basis
   -Have to start somewhere
   -Find cloud storage? Google drive, box, 
   -Test backups through a vm? or a modified bootable usb
